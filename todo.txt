- supplemental doc upload (xcarve gcode, subsystem notes/pics/sketches)?
    - no revisions
    - probably just a list of direct links in the part info table, rather than embeds
    - likely need delete buttons next to each link to remove docs
    - pdf, text/doc, images, spreadsheet, gcode (extensions?)
        - direct external links? Or should those just go in the notes section?
    - probably still <1 MB, should be enough for even images (but could bump to 2 or 3 MB if needed)
- User preferences (update name, email, password)
- Config screen for server settings
    - max file sizes
    - maybe just set per-project with a default
    - could put file management on the same screen for cleanup when the server runs low on room
- Remove extra status categories
    - Waiting for welding
    - Waiting for scotch-brite
    - Ready for anodize
    - Waiting for coating
    - material needs to be ordered (consolidate with "waiting for material")
- relabel "Material Cut Length -> "Rough Cut Length"
- move "Quantity required" right below notes
- Manufacturing method
    - opt. A: split "ready to manufacture"
    - opt. B: Additional Field
        - Mill, Lathe, 3D Print, X-Carve, Waterjet, Cut to size, Other
        - Probably implement "manufacturing dashboard" to sort by this
            - or tweak current dashboard to choose categorization method (status, etc.)
- "needs powdercoat" checkbox
- Add new part/assembly buttons to part screen (not just assembly screen)
- copy "quick status" dropdown from parts list to part info screen, too
- move form validation to submit.onclick, not on sinatra routes
- See about getting columns to wrap vertically in the 979px-767px range, rather than at 767px. Currently,
  it keeps columns horizontal, which is too small with the PDF embed.

- Hide ordering tab?
- Slack or email integration (#parts-notification channel)?
- What reports might be useful to have?
- changelog
- Practice vs competition (vs deprecated) - probably repurpose priorities?
    - spares, purgatory
- Don't allow "Ready for Manufacturing" unless "Drawing Created?" is checked
- links to onshape

- part owners (section leaders)
- assign part to person or "claim" parts
